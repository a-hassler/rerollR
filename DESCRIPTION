Description: An indirect method for exploring the effect of uncertainties of
    measurements on statistical test results. From one population of data,
    re_ functions generate “alternative populations” using Gaussian random
    number generation or bootstrapping. Together, these “alternative
    populations” explore the space of intra-individual (or intra-object)
    uncertainties of measurements. From two sets of “alternative populations”,
    roll_ functions perform series oft-tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests or
    randomization tests and provide metrics and graphic representations of
    resulting p-value distributions.
